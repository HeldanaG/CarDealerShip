# 🚗 Dealership Management System 🚗

A Java-based inventory and contract management system designed to support multiple dealerships. Each dealer can manage their vehicle inventory, process customer sales and lease contracts, and retain detailed, dealership-specific records. This application is ideal for leasing to individual dealerships, offering them a self-contained digital solution.

## 📌 Features

### ✅ Inventory Management (Per Dealer)

- Every dealership creates its own vehicle inventory file, e.g. PrimeAuto.csv

- Add, remove, and view all vehicles

- Search vehicles by:

    - Price range

    - Make & Model

    - Year

    - Color

    - Mileage

    - Type (SUV, Car, Truck, etc.)

### ✅ Customer Sales & Leasing

- Process vehicle sales or leases

- Financing logic based on price tiers

- Lease eligibility restricted to newer vehicles (≤ 3 years old)

- After each contract:

  - A receipt is printed

  - A contract file is created per dealer, e.g. PrimeAutoContracts.csv

### ✅ Multi-Dealer Support

- Each dealer gets:

    - 1 inventory file: DealerName.csv

    - 1 contracts file: DealerNameContracts.csv

    - Keeps records isolated per dealership, allowing easy distribution of the software to multiple businesses

### ✅ User & Dealership Setup

- Dealership profile creation (name, address, phone)

- First-time and returning login logic

- Saves and loads each dealership’s own vehicle inventory and contracts

## 💻 How It Works

- When the program starts, the dealer either logs in or registers

- Their own inventory file is loaded and displayed

- Sales and leases are processed via a menu interface

- All contracts and vehicle changes are saved per-dealer
